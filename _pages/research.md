My research focuses on the applied mathematics, with a particular interest in understanding the mechanical metamaterials from a mathmatical perspective. 

Mechanical metamaterials are carefully designed materials that exhibit exotic functionalities. 


My current projects can be categorized into three areas:
<ul>
	<li> <b>Effective elastic behavior of mechanical metamaterials</b></li>
	This project addresses problems from an emerging area of mechanics known as mechanical metamaterials (<a href='https://www.nature.com/articles/natrevmats201766'>here</a> is a Nature review article by Bertoldi et. al). These materials often consist of periodically arranged building blocks, resembling elastic composites. However, compared to the traditional elastic composites, these mechanism-based mechanical metamaterials are more degenerate, since they can deform with zero elastic energy. Such deformations are called mechanisms. 

	One fascinating consequence of the presence of mechanisms in metamaterials is their degenerate elastic behavior. In fact, these materials possess "soft modes", which are large deformations that require only a small amount of elastic energy. Interestingly, the soft modes often result in global deformations that are entirely different from those of the mechanisms. A significant portion of my research focuses on developing an effective theory to study some special mechanism-based mechanical metamaterials where the macroscopic energy vanishes.

	A vivid and illustrative example for explaining our work on mechanism-based mechanical metamaterials is the Kagome lattice. 

	This is a joint work with my advisor Robert V. Kohn at Courant Institute.
